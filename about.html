<p>Last weekend, we - <a href="http://raeknowler.name/">Rae</a> and <a href="http://www.zarkonnen.com">David</a> - participated in the <a href="http://www.gamespace.ch/post/125425328044/summer-game-jam">Zurich&nbsp;Summer&nbsp;Game&nbsp;Jam</a>, a two-day jam organized by our friend <a href="http://kahlina.com/">Dragica</a>.</p>

<p>You can play the resulting game in its current state <a href="index.html">here</a>. If the game doesn't load or you get stuck, just reload the page.</p>

<div class="section">
<img src="about-img/goatman-concept.png">
<p>We both really love exploration games, so we wanted to make one of those. But one problem with pure exploration is that eventually you run out of new stuff to see. The world either ends or repeats itself increasingly. One way to fix this is to make the world react to the player, changing in a way that re-exploring existing territory keeps the game interesting.</p>

<p>This led us to think about the ethics and impact of exploration, and how "exploring" a place assumes the place itself is passive and can be consumed as like "content". An idea like "take nothing but photographs, leave nothing but footprints" requires the place to be passive and not react to your mere presence.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<img src="about-img/butcher.png">
<p>Having hit upon a core idea, we set about designing a game that would embody it. We could have created a more or less linear narrative game which simply told a story about exploration's unintended consequences. But neither of us is big on narrative in games: we wanted a game whose mechanics actually represented our core concept, a game with a living world.</p>

<p>This was of course vastly overambitious for a two-day game jam, but we gave it a good try, as you will see. This post doubles as a kind of "art book" for our game concept, like the physical art books that sometimes get created after the end of an ambitious film or game project, showcasing all the cool concept art and ideas that had to be dropped to get the project completed.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<img src="about-img/sleep-concept.png">
<p>In the game, you travel to a dream world created jointly by multiple dreamers, inspired somewhat by the Land in Neil Gaiman's <a href="http://www.tor.com/2013/02/13/the-sandman-reread-a-game-of-you/">A&nbsp;Game&nbsp;of&nbsp;You</a> and Jeff Noon's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vurt">Vurt</a>. The dreamers manifest in the landscape, as rock formations, trees, tangles of vines, and they affect the land around them.</p>

<p>Your aim is to collect and bring back dream fragments for your uncle's eclectic collection.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<img src="about-img/bower-bird-concept.png">
<p>The world is also inhabited, by animal-headed dream people. The dreamers' dreams and nightmares manifest as structures, plants and animals that the dream people consume to survive.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<img src="about-img/vine-dreamer.png">
<h3>The Vine Dreamer</h3>

<p>Manifesting as a face made from a tangle of vines, this dreamer covers the nearby lands with near-impenetrable vine thickets.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<img src="about-img/tree.png">
<p>Knife-trees also grow nearby, which can be harvested to get blades.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<img src="img/bower-bird.png">
<p>The lands around the vine dreamer are inhabited by bower bird people, who collect the vines and turn them into ropes and nets. The bower bird people spend much of their time building and adjusting their bowers and are always interested in beautiful or exotic items to use as decoration.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<img src="about-img/bower.png">
<p>As you visit them and trade them new items, you inflame an arms race between the bower-builders. Everyone needs new and exotic things for their bowers. As the bower bird people abandon their weaving trade in their newfound obsession, the vines begin to grow outwards, choking the lands.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<img src="about-img/bone-dreamer.png">
<h3>The Bone Dreamer</h3>

<p>Bones grow out of the ground near the giant skull of the bone dreamer. Bones are useful both as building material and for making soup.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<img src="about-img/hole.png">
<p>A large number of deep holes dot the ground nearby. Inside, bowls, jugs - more holes - grow and accumulate.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<img src="img/star-nosed-mole.png">
<p>Nearby, the star-nosed mole people live. They keep mostly to themselves but will trade their surplus earthenware with others. Your arrival, and the resulting realization of the nature of their world, causes their society to break down.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<img src="about-img/mountain-dreamer.png">
<h3>The Mountain Dreamer</h3>

<p>A tall and jagged mountain with caves represents this dreamer.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<img src="about-img/anger-bush.png">
<p>Large boulders dot the landscape, interspersed with large bushes growing red berries, created by the dreamer's anger.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<img src="about-img/brewery.png">
<p>This area is inhabited by bat people, who harvest the berries and brew them into beer. They also create and sell candles that can be used to travel through the passageways between holes.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<img src="img/bat.png">
<p>Bat people feed on swarms of golden insects. Unfortunately, when the bower birds become obsessed, they start catching the insects in large quantities, leaving the bats to starve.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<img src="about-img/berries.png">
<p>Those are the three dreamers and peoples we implemented. With each kind of villager, your appearance or interaction with them can spark off a change to the dream-world. Since you do need to interact with them for supplies, you have to become aware that the dreamland is a complex system of interactions that includes you.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<img src="img/large-machete.png">
<p>So if you are careless, the dream world destabilizes: vines and knife-forests choke everything, some villages go to war with each other, other villagers become crazy or addicted or obsessed. And the dreamers suffer. Each time you wake up, you notice that everyone around you has increasingly disturbed sleep.</p>

<p>We didn't quite get to that point: Currently, the villagers simply stand around. Visiting certain buildings will gain you gifts that will let you better traverse the dreamscape.<p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<img src="about-img/temple.png">
<p>And each village has one dream temple containing a dream for you to collect.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<img src="about-img/crafting.jpg">
<p>Ultimately, the idea is for the villagers to lead real lives: they will move around, craft and build, trade between each other and you. They will require food and sometimes medicine. And the game is closer to this state than you might think: underlying the currently rather static world is a powerful engine based on entity interactions. Offering a trade to the player uses the same interaction system as trading between villagers, as checking whether you can climb over a boulder.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<img src="img/frigate-bird.png">
<p>Of course, we had concepts for many more dreamers and dream people:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lizard-people whose status fights turn bloody when you introduce them to knives</li>
<li>Friendly Seahorse-people who become ill when they touch you</li>
<li>Centipede-people whose hunts start threatening everyone</li>
<li>Ultra-territorial mountain goat people</li>
<li>Boar-people whose fondness for anger beer causes them to smash things</li>
<li>Scaredy deer-people with a tendency to medicine addiction</li>
<li>Frog-people who become obsessed with who you are and come from</li>
<li>Proud frigate-bird-people</li>
<li>Snake-people who prey on the eggs of penguin-people</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<img src="about-img/rope.png">
<p>All of these people, their trades, their lives and resources, would be expressed using the same interaction engine. In fact, if you wanted to abandon your quest to gather dream fragments and live with the villagers and do as they do, you could do that: the interactions available to you are the same as the dream-people have.</p>

<p>With one important exception, of course: you can wake up.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<img src="about-img/batcave.png">
<p>Art-wise, after Rae sketched out some initial visual concepts, we decided to use old prints for the animal heads and dreams. On the evening of the first day and the morning of the second, David sat down with a graphics tablet and churned out the tile and item graphics. To keep the art looking consistent and not spend too much time on individual images, he used a simple colour palette of four base colors in five different levels of brighness each, and stuck to using a single brush size.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<img src="about-img/bone.png">
<p>We then adopted this colour scheme across the game, tinting the prints in the same shades and using the colours for in-game UI elements and text. The visual appearance of the game as it stands is a pretty clear indicator of how a coherent palette and style is more important than the quality of individual pieces of artwork.</p>

<p>What's next? If we find time to revisit the game, the very next step would be to start animating the villagers, imbuing them with lives of their own...<p>
